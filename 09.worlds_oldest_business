-- 1. What is the oldest business on each continent?
SELECT
    c.continent,
    c.country,
    b.business,
    b.year_founded
FROM
    businesses b
    INNER JOIN countries c ON b.country_code = c.country_code
WHERE
    b.year_founded = (
        SELECT MIN(b2.year_founded)
        FROM businesses b2
        INNER JOIN countries c2 ON b2.country_code = c2.country_code
        WHERE c2.continent = c.continent
    );

-- 2. How many countries per continent lack data on the oldest businesses
SELECT c.continent, COUNT(c.country_code) AS countries_without_businesses
FROM countries as c
LEFT JOIN 
	(SELECT * 
	FROM businesses
	UNION ALL
	SELECT *
	FROM new_businesses) b
	ON c.country_code=b.country_code
WHERE b.business IS NULL
GROUP BY c.continent

-- Does including the `new_businesses` data change this?

-- 3. Which business categories are best suited to last over the course of centuries?
SELECT continent, category, MIN(year_founded) AS year_founded
FROM businesses b
INNER JOIN categories cat ON b.category_code = cat.category_code
INNER JOIN countries c ON b.country_code = c.country_code
GROUP BY c.continent, cat.category
ORDER BY c.continent, cat.category

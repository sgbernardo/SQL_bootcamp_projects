This project was based on a study conducted by a Japanese university, aiming to explore whether going to a university in a different country affects one's mental health. Specifically, the dataset explores whether there is a difference between the mental health of domestic and international students studying in Japan. The SQL script I created concluded that international students are at higher risk of mental health challenges, which is similar to the study conducted previously.

This project examines international debt data collected by the World Bank, which contains debt amounts owed by 124 countries in each category. China has the highest debt amounting to $285.7 billion. On the other hand, Timor-Leste has the lowest amount of principal repayments, amounting to $825,000. This means that Timor-Leste continues to meet its debt obligations with the World Bank, but is subject to longer maturities to meet debt obligations.

**3. Analyze Industry Carbon Emissions (industry_carbon_emissions)** - Beginner

This project examines carbon emissions of companies, where the dataset contains the industries the company is in and total carbon emissions for a given year. The result of this project shows that the materials industry, composing of 7 companies, make up for the highest carbon footprint in 2017.

**3. When Was the Golden Era of Video Games?** - Beginner

This project examines data from the video gaming industry. The following findings were noted:
- Finding the top 10 video games: Wii Sport for Wii (2006) was the top-selling game in the data set, with sales of 82.9 million copies. It is worth noting that Nintendo published 7 out of 10 of the top 10 games. 
- Finding the top 10 years with the highest critic scores: 1998 was the year when the highest critic scores of 9.32 were achieved, based on years with at least 4 games released for a fairer assessment.
- Finding the top 10 years with the highest critic and user scores: 1998 was the year when both critics and users agreed in terms of scores (with a difference of only 0.08), indicating that the same year was the golden age for video games.

# SQL Practice Projects
This repository contains notes and codes in preparation for the SQL live interview. This will contain the code, and the output. 


## DataCamp Projects:



**1. Analyzing International Debt Statistics (DataCamp_Student_Mental_Health)** - Beginner

    https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/7f0205a0-56eb-4621-8678-87b0cdea1ea6/edit

This project was based on a study conducted by a Japanese university, aiming to explore whether going to a university in a different country affects one's mental health. Specifically, the dataset explores whether there is a difference between the mental health of domestic and international students studying in Japan. The SQL script I created concluded that international students are at higher risk of mental health challenges, which is similar to the study conducted previously. 

**2. Analyze International Debt Statistics (international_debt_statistics)** - Beginner

    https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/607b83ce-5e64-4296-aef4-4593514c199f/edit

This project examines international debt data collected by the World Bank, which contains debt amounts owed by 124 countries in each category. China has the highest debt amounting to $285.7 billion. On the other hand, Timor-Leste has the lowest amount of principal repayments, amounting to $825,000. This means that Timor-Leste continues to meet its debt obligations with the World Bank, but is subject to longer maturities to meet debt obligations.

**3. Analyze Industry Carbon Emissions (industry_carbon_emissions)** - Beginner

    https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/963085d0-5ec6-4677-bc5b-9b4030c56685/edit

This project examines carbon emissions of companies, where the dataset contains the industries the company is in and total carbon emissions for a given year. The result of this project shows that the materials industry, composing of 7 companies, make up for the highest carbon footprint in 2017.

**4. When Was the Golden Era of Video Games? (video_games_golden_era)** - Beginner

    https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/b52d5d31-ea43-42fa-8655-b9c3c6a9f391/edit

This project examines data from the video gaming industry. The following findings were noted:
- Finding the top 10 video games: Wii Sport for Wii (2006) was the top-selling game in the data set, with sales of 82.9 million copies. It is worth noting that Nintendo published 7 out of 10 of the top 10 games. 
- Finding the top 10 years with the highest critic scores: 1998 was the year when the highest critic scores of 9.32 were achieved, based on years with at least 4 games released for a fairer assessment.
- Finding the top 10 years with the highest critic and user scores: 1998 was the year when both critics and users agreed in terms of scores (with a difference of only 0.08), indicating that the same year was the golden age for video games.

**5. Exploring Trends in American Baby Names(american_baby_names)** - Beginner

    https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/c8880bd1-961a-4c8f-b713-0853385091e0/edit

This project examines the popularity of baby names from 1920 to 2020.


**6. Impact Analysis of GoodThought NGO Initiatives (GoodThought_Impact_Analysis)** - Intermediate

    https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/0141a769-0df3-4b49-9d81-a0206db32c0a/edit

This project examines how data can be utilised to assess and drive positive change in humanitarian efforts. In the Case of Good Thought, each humanitarian (labeled as assignments) are evaluated through impact score as well as donations received from donors. I also identified the most impactful assignment for each region.

**7. Factors that Fuel Student Performance (student_performance)** - Intermediate

    https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/be25cc33-47d9-4cd1-8d7d-cb189a7fd143/edit

This project examines student performance data to identify the key drivers of success, which can inform policy interventions aimed at enhancing student outcomes. The first finding points out that students that engaged in extracurricular activities who studied the most obtained the highest average score. This was further substantiated by the second problem, where students who studied more than 16 hours weekly had the highest exam scores. Finally, I also provided the teacher with student exam rankings for her use. While the data suggests that studying more hours leads to higher scores, further analysis should be conducted to determine the relationships between exam scores and other factors, such as sleep, attendance, tutoring sessions, and teacher quality. Using the SQL data extracted, they can use techniques such as linear and logistic regression, or a combination of both, to understand the drivers and policy interventions needed. 

**8. Analyzing Electric Vehicle Charging Habits (EV_Charging_Data)** - Intermediate

    https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/22bf2713-2b46-4cb7-a22d-c09bb1dc536d/edit

This project aims to analyze trends in EV usage such as the garage with the most number of customers, users who spend the most time charging in one session, and the most popular charging day/time.

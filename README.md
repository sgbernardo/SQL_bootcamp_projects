This project was based on a study conducted by a Japanese university, aiming to explore whether going to a university in a different country affects one's mental health. Specifically, the dataset explores whether there is a difference between the mental health of domestic and international students studying in Japan. The SQL script I created concluded that international students are at higher risk of mental health challenges, which is similar to the study conducted previously.

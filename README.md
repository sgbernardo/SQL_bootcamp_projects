This project was based on a study conducted by a Japanese university, aiming to explore whether going to a university in a different country affects one's mental health. Specifically, the dataset explores whether there is a difference between the mental health of domestic and international students studying in Japan. The SQL script I created concluded that international students are at higher risk of mental health challenges, which is similar to the study conducted previously. 

**2. Analyze International Debt Statistics (international_debt_statistics)**

This project examines international debt data collected by the World Bank, which contains debt amounts owed by 124 countries in each category. China has the highest debt amounting to $285.7 billion. On the other hand, Timor-Leste has the lowest amount of principal repayments, amounting to $825,000. This means that Timor-Leste continues to meet its debt obligations with the World Bank, but is subject to longer maturities to meet debt obligations.
